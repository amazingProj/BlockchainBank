              Prehistory Further information: Prehistory of the Levant The
              oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern Israel,
              dating to 1.5 million years ago, was found in Ubeidiya near the
              Sea of Galilee.[49] Other notable Paleolithic sites include the
              caves Tabun, Qesem and Manot. The oldest fossils of anatomically
              modern humans found outside Africa are the Skhul and Qafzeh
              hominins, who lived in the area that is now northern Israel
              120,000 years ago.[50] Around 10th millennium BCE, the Natufian
              culture existed in the area.[51] Antiquity Main article: History
              of ancient Israel and Judah Further information: Israelites,
              Kingdom of Israel (Samaria), and Kingdom of Judah The Large Stone
              Structure, an archaeological site in Jerusalem The early history
              of the territory is unclear.[24]: 104  Modern archaeology has
              largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah
              concerning the patriarchs, The Exodus, and the conquest of Canaan
              described in the Book of Joshua, and instead views the narrative
              as constituting the Israelites' national myth.[52] During the Late
              Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed vassal
              states paying tribute to the New Kingdom of Egypt, whose
              administrative headquarters lay in Gaza.[53] Ancestors of the
              Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic-speaking
              peoples native to this area.[54]: 78–79  The Israelites and their
              culture, according to the modern archaeological account, did not
              overtake the region by force, but instead branched out of these
              Canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a
              distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on
              Yahweh.[55][56][57][58][59][60][excessive citations] The
              archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like
              centres, but with more limited resources and a small
              population.[61] Villages had populations of up to 300 or
              400,[62][63] which lived by farming and herding, and were largely
              self-sufficient;[64] economic interchange was prevalent.[65]
              Writing was known and available for recording, even in small
              sites.[66] While it is unclear if there was ever a United
              Monarchy,[67][68] there is well-accepted archeological evidence
              referring to "Israel" in the Merneptah Stele which dates to about
              1200 BCE;[69][70][71] and the Canaanites are archaeologically
              attested in the Middle Bronze Age (2100–1550 BCE).[23][72] There
              is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel
              and Judah and their extent and power, but historians and
              archaeologists agree that a Kingdom of Israel existed by ca. 900
              BCE[24]: 169–195 [73] and that a Kingdom of Judah existed by ca.
              700 BCE.[25] Map of Israel and Judah in the 9th century BCE The
              Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two kingdoms and
              soon developed into a regional power;[74] during the days of the
              Omride dynasty, it controlled Samaria, Galilee, the upper Jordan
              Valley, the Sharon and large parts of the Transjordan.[75] It was
              destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the
              Neo-Assyrian Empire.[26] The Kingdom of Judah later became a
              client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the
              Neo-Babylonian Empire. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered
              Judah. According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple and
              Jerusalem were destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar II, who
              subsequently exiled the Jews to Babylon. The defeat was also
              recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles.[76][77] The Babylonian
              exile ended around 538 BCE under the rule of the Medo-Persian
              Cyrus the Great after he captured Babylon.[78][79] The Second
              Temple was constructed around 520 BCE.[78] As part of the Persian
              Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah
              (Yehud Medinata) with different borders, covering a smaller
              territory.[80] The population of the province was greatly reduced
              from that of the kingdom, archaeological surveys showing a
              population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries
              BCE.[24]: 308 Classical period Main article: Second Temple period
              Further information: Hasmonean dynasty, Herodian dynasty, and
              Jewish–Roman wars Portion of the Temple Scroll, one of the Dead
              Sea Scrolls, written during the Second Temple period With
              successive Persian rule, the autonomous province Yehud Medinata
              was gradually developing back into urban society, largely
              dominated by Judeans. The Greek conquests largely skipped the
              region without any resistance or interest. Incorporated into the
              Ptolemaic and finally the Seleucid empires, the southern Levant
              was heavily hellenized, building the tensions between Judeans and
              Greeks. The conflict erupted in 167 BCE with the Maccabean Revolt,
              which succeeded in establishing an independent Hasmonean Kingdom
              in Judah, which later expanded over much of modern Israel and
              parts of Jordan and Lebanon, as the Seleucids gradually lost
              control in the region.[81][82][83] The Roman Republic invaded the
              region in 63 BCE, first taking control of Syria, and then
              intervening in the Hasmonean Civil War. The struggle between
              pro-Roman and pro-Parthian factions in Judea eventually led to the
              installation of Herod the Great and consolidation of the Herodian
              kingdom as a vassal Judean state of Rome. Herod undertook many
              colossal building projects, including fully rebuilding and
              enlarging the Second Temple. With the decline of the Herodian
              dynasty, Judea transformed into a Roman province. The first and
              second centuries CE saw a series of unsuccessful large-scale
              Jewish rebellions against Rome. The Roman suppression of these
              revolts led to wide-scale destruction, a very high toll of life
              and enslavement. The First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE) resulted in
              the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, which
              necessitated a reshaping of Judaism to ensure its survival without
              a temple. These events eventually resulted in the emergence of
              Rabbinic Judaism.[84][85][86] Two generations later, the Bar
              Kokhba Revolt (132-136 CE) erupted. Judea's countryside was
              devastated, and many were killed, displaced or sold into
              slavery.[87][88][89][90] Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony
              under the name of Aelia Capitolina, and the province of Judea was
              renamed Syria Palaestina.[91][92] Jewish presence in the region
              significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba
              revolt.[93] Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish
              presence and Galilee became its religious center.[94][95] Jewish
              communities continued to reside in the southern Hebron Hills and
              on the coastal plain.[90] The Mishnah and part of the Talmud,
              central Jewish texts, were composed during the 2nd to 4th
              centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem.[96] When the area stood
              under Byzantine rule, Christianity gradually evolved over Roman
              Paganism.[97] By the 4th century, the Jews had become a
              minority.[98] The immigration of Christians, along with
              conversions of locals, resulted in the formation of a Christian
              majority.[99][100] Through the 5th and 6th centuries, the dramatic
              events of the repeated Samaritan revolts reshaped the land, with
              massive destruction to Byzantine Christian and Samaritan societies
              and a resulting decrease of the population.[101] After the Persian
              conquest and the installation of a short-lived Jewish Commonwealth
              in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire reconquered the country in
              628.[102] Middle Ages and modern history Further information:
              History of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages, Muslim conquest of
              the Levant, Crusades, and Old Yishuv Kfar Bar'am, an ancient
              Jewish village, abandoned some time between the 7th–13th centuries
              CE.[103] In 634–641 CE, the region, including Jerusalem, was
              conquered by the Arabs who had recently adopted Islam. Control of
              the region transferred between the Rashidun Caliphs, Umayyads,
              Abbasids, Fatimids, Seljuks, Crusaders, and Ayyubids throughout
              the next three centuries.[104] During the siege of Jerusalem by
              the First Crusade in 1099, the Jewish inhabitants of the city
              fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim
              population who tried in vain to defend the city against the
              Crusaders. When the city fell, around 60,000 people were
              massacred, including 6,000 Jews seeking refuge in a
              synagogue.[105] At this time, a full thousand years after the fall
              of the Jewish state, there were Jewish communities all over the
              country. Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem, Tiberias,
              Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza.[106] According to Albert of
              Aachen, the Jewish residents of Haifa were the main fighting force
              of the city, and "mixed with Saracen [Fatimid] troops", they
              fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by
              the Crusader fleet and land army.[107][108] In 1165, Maimonides
              visited Jerusalem and prayed on the Temple Mount, in the "great,
              holy house."[109] In 1141, the Spanish-Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi
              issued a call for Jews to migrate to the Land of Israel, a journey
              he undertook himself. In 1187, Sultan Saladin, founder of the
              Ayyubid dynasty, defeated the Crusaders in the Battle of Hattin
              and subsequently captured Jerusalem and almost all of Palestine.
              In time, Saladin issued a proclamation inviting Jews to return and
              settle in Jerusalem,[110] and according to Judah al-Harizi, they
              did: "From the day the Arabs took Jerusalem, the Israelites
              inhabited it."[111] Al-Harizi compared Saladin's decree allowing
              Jews to re-establish themselves in Jerusalem to the one issued by
              the Persian king Cyrus the Great over 1,600 years earlier.[112]
              The 13th-century Ramban Synagogue in Jerusalem In 1211, the Jewish
              community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a
              group headed by over 300 rabbis from France and England,[113]
              among them Rabbi Samson ben Abraham of Sens.[114] Nachmanides
              (Ramban), the 13th-century Spanish rabbi and recognized leader of
              Jewry, greatly praised the Land of Israel and viewed its
              settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all Jews. He
              wrote "If the gentiles wish to make peace, we shall make peace and
              leave them on clear terms; but as for the land, we shall not leave
              it in their hands, nor in the hands of any nation, not in any
              generation."[115] In 1260, control passed to the Mamluk sultans of
              Egypt.[116] The country was located between the two centres of
              Mamluk power, Cairo and Damascus, and only saw some development
              along the postal road connecting the two cities. Jerusalem,
              although left without the protection of any city walls since 1219,
              also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the
              Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount. In 1266, the Mamluk
              Sultan Baybars converted the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron into
              an exclusive Islamic sanctuary and banned Christians and Jews from
              entering, who previously had been able to enter it for a fee. The
              ban remained in place until Israel took control of the building in
              1967.[117][118] Jews at the Western Wall in the 1870s In 1470,
              Isaac b. Meir Latif arrived from Italy and counted 150 Jewish
              families in Jerusalem.[119] Thanks to Joseph Saragossi who had
              arrived in the closing years of the 15th century, Safed and its
              environs had developed into the largest concentration of Jews in
              Palestine. With the help of the Sephardic immigration from Spain,
              the Jewish population had increased to 10,000 by the early 16th
              century.[120] In 1516, the region was conquered by the Ottoman
              Empire; it remained under Turkish rule until the end of the First
              World War, when Britain defeated the Ottoman forces and set up a
              military administration across the former Ottoman Syria. In 1660,
              a Druze revolt led to the destruction of Safed and Tiberias.[121]
              In the late 18th century, local Arab Sheikh Zahir al-Umar created
              a de facto independent Emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to
              subdue the Sheikh failed, but after Zahir's death the Ottomans
              regained control of the area. In 1799 governor Jazzar Pasha
              successfully repelled an assault on Acre by troops of Napoleon,
              prompting the French to abandon the Syrian campaign.[122] In 1834
              a revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants broke out against Egyptian
              conscription and taxation policies under Muhammad Ali. Although
              the revolt was suppressed, Muhammad Ali's army retreated and
              Ottoman rule was restored with British support in 1840.[123]
              Shortly after, the Tanzimat reforms were implemented across the
              Ottoman Empire. In 1920, after the Allies conquered the Levant
              during World War I, the territory was divided between Britain and
              France under the mandate system, and the British-administered area
              which included modern day Israel was named Mandatory
              Palestine.[116][124][125] Zionism and British Mandate Main
              articles: Zionism, Yishuv, Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, Mandatory
              Palestine, and Mandate for Palestine Further information: Balfour
              Declaration and Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine The
              First Zionist Congress (1897) in Basel, Switzerland Since the
              existence of the earliest Jewish diaspora, many Jews have aspired
              to return to "Zion" and the "Land of Israel",[126] though the
              amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a
              matter of dispute.[127] The hopes and yearnings of Jews living in
              exile are an important theme of the Jewish belief system.[128]
              After the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, some communities
              settled in Palestine.[129] During the 16th century, Jewish
              communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities—Jerusalem,
              Tiberias, Hebron, and Safed—and in 1697, Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led
              a group of 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem.[130] In the second half of the
              18th century, Eastern European opponents of Hasidism, known as the
              Perushim, settled in Palestine.[131][132] "Therefore I believe
              that a wonderous generation of Jews will spring into existence.
              The Maccabaeans will rise again. Let me repeat once more my
              opening words: The Jews wish to have a State, and they shall have
              one. We shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and die
              peacefully in our own home. The world will be freed by our
              liberty, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness. And
              whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare will
              react with beneficent force for the good of humanity." Theodor
              Herzl (1896). A Jewish State – via Wikisource. [scan Wikisource
              link] The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled
              Palestine, known as the First Aliyah, began in 1881, as Jews fled
              pogroms in Eastern Europe.[133][better source needed] The First
              Aliyah laid the cornerstone for widespread Jewish settlement in
              Palestine. From 1881 to 1903, the Jews had established dozens of
              settlements and purchased about 350,000 dunams of land. At the
              same time, the revival of the Hebrew language began among Jews in
              Palestine, spurred on largely by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a
              Russian-born Jew who had settled in Jerusalem in 1881. Jews were
              encouraged to speak Hebrew in the place of other languages, a
              Hebrew school system began to emerge, and new words were coined or
              borrowed from other languages for modern inventions and concepts.
              As a result, Hebrew gradually became the predominant language of
              the Jewish community of Palestine, which until then had been
              divided into different linguistic communities that primarily used
              Hebrew for religious purposes and as a means of communication
              between Jews with different native languages. Although the Zionist
              movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist
              Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism,[134] a
              movement that sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of
              Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called Jewish question
              of the European states, in conformity with the goals and
              achievements of other national projects of the time.[135] In 1896,
              Herzl published Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State), offering his
              vision of a future Jewish state; the following year he presided
              over the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland.[136] The
              Second Aliyah (1904–14) began after the Kishinev pogrom; some
              40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half of them
              left eventually.[133] Both the first and second waves of migrants
              were mainly Orthodox Jews,[137] although the Second Aliyah
              included socialist groups who established the kibbutz
              movement.[138] Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely
              sought to create communal agricultural settlements, the period
              also saw the establishment of Tel Aviv in 1909 as the "first
              Hebrew city." This period also saw the appearance of Jewish armed
              self-defense organizations as a means of defense for Jewish
              settlements. The first such organization was Bar-Giora, a small
              secret guard founded in 1907. Two years later, larger Hashomer
              organization was founded as its replacement. During World War I,
              British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent the Balfour
              Declaration to Lord Rothschild (Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron
              Rothschild), a leader of the British Jewish community, that stated
              that Britain intended for the creation of a Jewish "national home"
              in Palestine.[139][140] In 1918, the Jewish Legion, a group
              primarily of Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British conquest
              of Palestine.[141] Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish
              immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a
              Jewish militia known as the Haganah (meaning "The Defense" in
              Hebrew) in 1920 as an outgrowth of Hashomer, from which the Irgun
              and Lehi (or the Stern Gang) paramilitaries later split off.[142]
              In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate for
              Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with
              its promise to the Jews, and with similar provisions regarding the
              Arab Palestinians.[143] The population of the area at this time
              was predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about
              11%,[144] and Arab Christians about 9.5% of the population.[145]
              The Third (1919–23) and Fourth Aliyahs (1924–29) brought an
              additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine.[133] The rise of Nazism and
              the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the
              Fifth Aliyah, with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This
              was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936–39, which was
              launched as a reaction to continued Jewish immigration and land
              purchases. Several hundred Jews and British security personnel
              were killed, while the British Mandate authorities alongside the
              Zionist militias of the Haganah and Irgun killed 5,032 Arabs and
              wounded 14,760,[146][147] resulting in over ten percent of the
              adult male Palestinian Arab population killed, wounded, imprisoned
              or exiled.[148] The British introduced restrictions on Jewish
              immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939. With
              countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing
              the Holocaust, a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was
              organized to bring Jews to Palestine.[133] By the end of World War
              II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 31% of the
              total population.[149] After World War II Further information:
              United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, 1947–1949 Palestine
              war, and Israeli Declaration of Independence UN Map, "Palestine
              plan of partition with economic union" After World War II, the UK
              found itself facing a Jewish guerrilla campaign over Jewish
              immigration restrictions, as well as continued conflict with the
              Arab community over limit levels. The Haganah joined Irgun and
              Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule.[150] At the same
              time, hundreds of thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and
              refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in
              Europe. The Haganah attempted to bring these refugees to Palestine
              in a program called Aliyah Bet in which tens of thousands of
              Jewish refugees attempted to enter Palestine by ship. Most of the
              ships were intercepted by the Royal Navy and the refugees rounded
              up and placed in detention camps in Atlit and Cyprus by the
              British.[151][152] On 22 July 1946, Irgun bombed the British
              administrative headquarters for Palestine, which was housed in the
              southern wing[153] of the King David Hotel in
              Jerusalem.[154][155][156] A total of 91 people of various
              nationalities were killed and 46 were injured.[157] The hotel was
              the site of the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the
              Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Mandatory Palestine
              and Transjordan.[157][158] The attack initially had the approval
              of the Haganah. It was conceived as a response to Operation Agatha
              (a series of widespread raids, including one on the Jewish Agency,
              conducted by the British authorities) and was the deadliest
              directed at the British during the Mandate era.[157][158] The
              Jewish insurgency continued throughout the rest of 1946 and 1947
              despite concerted efforts by the British military and Palestine
              Police Force to suppress it. British efforts to mediate a
              negotiated solution with Jewish and Arab representatives also
              failed as the Jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did
              not involve a Jewish state and suggested a partition of Palestine
              into Jewish and Arab states, while the Arabs were adamant that a
              Jewish state in any part of Palestine was unacceptable and that
              the only solution was a unified Palestine under Arab rule. In
              February 1947, the British referred the Palestine issue to the
              newly formed United Nations. On 15 May 1947, the General Assembly
              of the United Nations resolved that the United Nations Special
              Committee on Palestine be created "to prepare for consideration at
              the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question
              of Palestine."[159] In the Report of the Committee dated 3
              September 1947 to the General Assembly,[160] the majority of the
              Committee in Chapter VI proposed a plan to replace the British
              Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish
              State, and the City of Jerusalem [...] the last to be under an
              International Trusteeship System."[161] Meanwhile, the Jewish
              insurgency continued and peaked in July 1947, with a series of
              widespread guerrilla raids culminating in the Sergeants affair.
              After three Irgun fighters had been sentenced to death for their
              role in the Acre Prison break, a May 1947 Irgun raid on Acre
              Prison in which 27 Irgun and Lehi militants were freed, the Irgun
              captured two British sergeants and held them hostage, threatening
              to kill them if the three men were executed. When the British
              carried out the executions, the Irgun responded by killing both
              hostages and hanged their bodies from eucalyptus trees,
              booby-trapping one of them with a mine which injured a British
              officer as he cut the body down. The hangings caused widespread
              outrage in Britain and were a major factor in the consensus
              forming in Britain that it was time to evacuate Palestine.
